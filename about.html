            üëã Hi, I'm <span class="element">Andreia</span>, an Aspiring
            Software Developer with passion for Web development and using code
            to scale ideas and problem solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            üíªI started my coding Journey in February 2023 with
            <span class="element">SheCodes</span>. After sucessfully finished 4
            coding workshops, I I have experience and thrive on developing Web
            applications using
            <span class="element">HTML, CSS, Java Script and React JS</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            ‚öõ With a background in Finance I'm eagering to make a transition to
            a career in Tech (<span class="element">why?</span> Because I want
            to do something I love everyday and Coding gives me a purpose to
            somehow contribute to something good and lifechanging in the World).
            Currently seeking Junior level opportunities where I can contribute
            to the design and development of innovative and scalable software
            solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            ü§ùI strongly belive in fostering relationships as the foundation for
            sucessful teamwork. <span class="element">Collaboration</span> and
            <span class="element">Open Communication</span> are vital components
            of my work ethic.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚ùìI'm a very determined, disciplined and resilient person. Always up
            to embrace change and challenge myself. Sometimes I'm very
            obstinated until I solve a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            üé∂Taking care of my mental health became a priority number one in my
            life. Therefore take some time to take care of myself is very
            important for me. Whether runnning, swimming, doing yoga, listen
            music or reading.
          </p>

          <p>
            ‚ú®My favourite quote is "It's all in our mind. I believe that our
            success depends a lot on what we believe in.
            <span class="element">The mind dominates everything</span> ".
